The Assignment
The assignment is described fully in thisLinks to an external site. document. Please complete the assignment as specified in that document. Please copy the code from your editor and paste it in the provided text area.

This assignment is very easy if you're paying close attention and following along in lecture and in recitiation. If you try to do this one totally on your own without coming to class, you're kind of doomed. Google will not be your friend on this assignment.

If you miss the lecture, please watch up through video 10 of the course videos:

It is not necessary to use xComputer to solve this problem (a text editor is fine) but if you want to download your own copy, use this link:

Download the file to your desktop. It should run by double-clicking on most machines. If this does not work for you, talk to me or one of the other leaders and we'll help, or you can just do it in the lab.

 

Blackbelt Challenge
This is the first assignment that has a blackbelt challenge. You may not attempt the blackbelt until you've got the basic version working, and your blackbelt must be a new file. The blackbelt challenge is to add a new twist to your multiplier. For example:

negative numbers Make your program handle multiplication of negative values
zero Handle zero as a multiplicand.
division See if you can make division work. It's fine to keep it integer division. Just calculate a quotient and a remainder
whatever else you can dream up
