=GOAL=
I want to make the computer come up with a random number between 1 and
100, and then I guess, and if I'm wrong, the computer will tell me if I
should guess higher or lower. When I'm right, it should tell me I got it,
and how many wrong guess I made.

=INPUTS=
User inputs numbers as a guess until they reach the random number
generated and they win hooray!

=OUTPUTS=
Ask user to guess number, on each guess give feedback whether they should
guess higher or lower.

=STEPS=
Generate random number 1-100 to guess and save in var randNum

Make int wrongGuesses = 0

Prompt user to guess a number 1-100 store input in var guess

while loop begins, as long as guess != randNum inc wrongGuess by one and
continue checking if the guess is higher or lower, and telling the user
which direction to guess and storing the next input in guess. The loop
repeats if guess isnt randNum.

When loop finishes, guess is correct, print good job and tell them how
many wrong guesses they did.
