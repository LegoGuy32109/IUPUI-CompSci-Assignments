=GOALS=
Let's have the user choose whether they want to guess or have the computer
guess a number they're thinking of. The computer will say how many guesses
they can find it in (I'll figure it out in 5 guesses) and then the user
will answer if they need to go higher, lower, or they got it.
=INPUTS=
User choice for what path to take, in the path of the computer guesses
they'll say what range the number is in, and then continue guessing until
they find it. The user will say if it needs to be higher, lower, or if
they found it.
=OUTPUTS=
Computer will give their guess (halfway point between range) and take the
user input for the next guess until they're correct or the user says they
aren't, then the computer will act confused and say the user did it wrong.
That will be funny.
=STEPS=
user says whether they want to guess or have the computer guess

If they want computer to guess, have the user say the min and max numbers
for the range the computer should guess between and store it two vars min
and max

computer will calculate number of maximum guess it would take them through
dividing by 2 narrowing it down, going to need to use powers of 2 to solve
that. I'm writing a funtion that will find how many times you can divide
the range by 2 until you get 0, then you must have found the number. Did
you know that if you had a range as big as every atom in the universe, it
would only take you 273 guesses to find it?

computer finds the halfway point between the range Max-min and you say if
it's higher than that or lower or they got it.

If it's lower, that guess -1 becomes the max.

If it's higer, that guess +1 becomes the min.

The halfway point continues

The while loop looping this only goes for the max guesses calculated until
the computer insults the user

Alright let's do this
