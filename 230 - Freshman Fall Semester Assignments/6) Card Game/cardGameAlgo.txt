=GOALS=
Follow the main function, and get desired output. 4 functions need to
written, clearDeck(), assignCard(), showDeck(), and showHand(). The trick
is having each integer value in cardLoc[] record what card it is, and
which player has it, deck, comp, or player.

=INPUT=
Have main function run with no edits.
def main():
  clearDeck()

  for i in range(5):
    assignCard(PLAYER)
    assignCard(COMP)

  showDeck()
  showHand(PLAYER)
  showHand(COMP)

=OUTPUT=
clears the deck, then draws cards to player and computer 5 times. Show the
deck, which says where every card is including in the players hands, then
list the cards specific in the players and computers hands.

=STEPS=
In clearDeck(), run through cardLoc and give it all 0's. It's in the deck.

In assignCard(), depending if player or comp is drawing set val to 1 or 2
respectfully to a random choice in cardLoc. Check if that card val is 0,
if not random choice again.

In showDeck(), run through every val in cardLoc[] and interpret which val
and suit it is. Index % 52 gives which val, % 13 gives which suit. It's
value 0, 1, or 2 says where it is.

Print each card's val and suit and where it is.

In showHand() interpret which player's hand to show, 1 or 2, and then loop
through each card location checking if it's that value. If it is, use same
method in showDeck to find it's suit and value, print that to the screen.
