=GOALS=
I want to spice up my program. I'm going to give the user an option to
generate a random key, and encode and decode messages through that. Also
expand functionality for spaces and punctutation in key.

=INPUT=
User choses they want a new random key from the menu, types '3'

=OUTPUT=
A message says a new key is generated and shows key, because why not? Now
when user wants to encode or decode the program uses that key to do it.

=STEPS=
Expand alpha string to include " .?!'()" and key string to include
"@#$%^&*"

Add option for user to type '3'

Interpret input 3 to run function newKey()

Create an array from the characters in key

set var newKey to be empty string

loop however long the length of key is, each time find a random choice of
the array and add it into the string new key, removing the character from
the array afterwards.

set key to newKey.

Print output statement that it worked and heres the key
