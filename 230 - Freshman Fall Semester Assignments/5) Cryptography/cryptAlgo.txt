I want to make a program that asks the user three things, encode
something, decode something, or quit. That functionality is handled in the
main already written. The functions I need to make are menu(), encode(),
and decode().
Menu is a simple while loop displaying the menu
SECRET DECODER MENU

  0) Quit
  1) Encode
  2) Decode

What do you want to do? :
and taking user input making sure they're saying an acceptable input.
Telling them you don't understand otherwise.
It ends when it's 0, 1, or 2 and returns that val to main.

encode() takes the user's string input and then turns it into uppercase,
then loops through every letter finding the index of that letter in the
alpha list and finding the corresponding letter with the same index in
key. That stores the char found in key with that index in output var.
Print output after loop and be done.

decode() takes user's string input that should be upper case but turns it
into uppercase just in case then does the same thing encode does but finds
the index in key and translates to alpha. Prints output after lower casing
it then .capitalize()
