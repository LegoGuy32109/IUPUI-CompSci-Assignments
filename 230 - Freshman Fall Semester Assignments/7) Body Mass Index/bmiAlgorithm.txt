BMI ALGORITHIM

==GOALS==
I want to be able to host a website with pages that ask the user for their
height and weight, and be able to then navigate them to a page that
displays their BMI along with what that means. Everything should have
labels so it's clear to the user what they need to do and what's being
displayed to them.

=INPUTS=
User puts in height and weight in a page, It's easy if there are two
inputs for height one for feet and the other inches. People don't always
like doing mental math. Then it can be calculated into inches anyway at
the end.

=OUTPUTS=
That above transitions into a result page that displays the BMI calculated
from that info. It also says what that BMI means through finding what
category it's in, overweight, underweight, normal, obese. Should have
option here for doing it again, or going to homepage through links.

=STEPS=
Have homepage with link to form

Have form contain <form> tag to enter height (feet and inches) and weight
in pounds. Make sure each <input> is labeled appropriately.

Have submit button in feild set with all labels and inputs for form page.

Make the form tag action go to /result and call the method post

In result.html make sure it begins with python script that gets the values
in the inputs and saves it to variables.

Set inches to the value of inches and feet*12

have the var bmi set to       703*pounds/(inches*inches)

create empty string message = ""

check if bmi is in a quadrant through if statement, and set message
appropriately like "hat's pretty low, your status is underweight" for
underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. Have each if statement closed
with end, because bottle is weird.

subtract inches by feet*12 for display

format bmi to a string rounded to 1 decimal point

Have html now display resuls with the variables formatted wiht {{ }}

Inculde links to calculate BMI again or back to home page
