==MISSION STATEMENT==
Im trying to make this program cooler, and flex coding knowledge by
proving my effort for the sweet grade. I'd like to run with Mr. Harris'
idea for vending machine functionality, so I'd like to display a list of
options for the user to choose. I already have cool dictonary looping in
my normal assignment, but ill use it here for the list too. The user picks
the items from an ID system like A1 and types 'end' when they're through.
Then it displays the total, and does the previous programs use of asking
for payment and giving change.

=INPUTS= User choices until they hit end

=OUTPUTS= Total cost from their choices and change

=STEPS=
Create a dictonary with item names and cost, but NOT IDs yet, because it's
easier for a computer to do that.

Display items in dictonary with a for loop, in the process displaying them
with an ID generated from an index as well as making a new dictonary with
the IDs as the key and the values as an array with the name and cost. ID
goes to the next letter every 6th item so when index%6==0, this resets
index to 1. I want a machine with 5 items per row.

While loop checking user input for the id of the item they want, like
typing in a physical vending machine. If wrong, ask again, should take a1
as well as A1 and such.

Each successful ID say what they got and add that to the total price, then
when that's over (type end) go calculate their change after they give
their payment.
