*screen recording here: https://youtu.be/suXZFFMWVq4*

To run the file, type `make` to compile the code to an executable called 'Heaps', which you can then run the executable on command line with `./Heaps`. The program will generate a Binary Tree fron the given numbers in the assignment: 
a combined heap from the two input heaps and display it to the user.

If you want to compile and run the program at the same time, you can type `make run`
