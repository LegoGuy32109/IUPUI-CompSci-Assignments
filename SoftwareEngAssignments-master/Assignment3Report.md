# Assignment 3 Report

## New classes

Of the new classes I have written, many of them are from splitting up the Users into a child classes inheriting from an abstract User class. I also have a UserCreator interface that provides classes for the Creation of both User types, Customer and Admin.

The two types are used instead of one, since the concerns of each are so seperated and don't need to be within the same class. I use the abstract User class to list them together in the store system, but when you're a Customer you don't even need the option for admin stuff and the same goes for Admin users. Each child of User has a `activateMenu()` method for rendering the interface for the user. The Admin and Customer classes add functionality to that class rendering a shopping list and administration options respectively.

I also added the FrontController class, as a object that can dispatch commands from the client to the remoteStore. It also authenticates users confirming their existance is valid in the store system, which then indicates it's apporpriate for the Client to proceed.

## Transition from Assignment #2 to #3

A general theme updating Assignment #2 was removing so much functionality from the `Client.java` class. I had both Admin and Customer menus funcionality in that class which made it huge, and now looks much more manageable thanks to refactoring the menu rendering to User child classes. It evens out the load, and sperates concerns for more effective development.

I'm also glad to remove some functionality in `RemoteStore.java` as there were a lot of logic checks being done to approve Item and User updates. Now, FrontController takes care of that and focuses on updating and confirming correct edits then sends them through to remoteStore to be enacted. A smaller file to look through in RemoteStore helps with seperating concerns for server connection, and internal system logic.
