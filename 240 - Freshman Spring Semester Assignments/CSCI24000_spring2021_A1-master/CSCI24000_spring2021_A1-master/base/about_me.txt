Hello! My name is Josh Hale and I am a Freshman at IUPUI.

I am graduating with a bachelor's in Computer Science, hence this class...

I have taken the prerequiste courses for this class at IUPUI, but I also have experience with CS classes in high school like AP CompSci A, where I got a good understanding of Java and Python. I have been interested in online tutorials for programming languages like C# and Ruby, but to tell you the truth I don't remember much lol :)

One of my best projects is a YouTube video I made using blender, animating a 3D rubberduck. The video has over 8k views, and the http link is here:

Scratch that, I don't know how to paste links or anything from the clipboard into vim. Not yet anyway! Just search 'Bubberducky Animated' if you're interested. 

Anything else I'd like to put here? umm..

Here's a lil dude doing a dance.

Bye!
