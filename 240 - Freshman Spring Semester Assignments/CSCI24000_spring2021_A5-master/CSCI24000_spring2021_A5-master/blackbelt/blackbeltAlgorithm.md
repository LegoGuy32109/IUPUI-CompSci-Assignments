GOALS
====
I want the program to handle a lot of edge cases, like no text on the line, if the amount of times is 0, and floating point numbers. Oh! And if the amount of times is negative.

A lot of this has been already accounted for, if at least accidentally in my base assignment. I would however like to have error messages pop up on the output.txt indicating what went wrong or why there isn't input. 

STEPS
====
Set the ints to floats

Have all the floats added together and set to another float to test if negative or 0

Establish logic to check if the line is "", floats <= 0, and display the error text on output.txt

I made the headers bigger than 3 hashtags because the algorithim isn't that long, I just need to focus and spend the day on making sure all edge cases are handled for this project.
