### Goals ###
I want this blackbelt to be similar to the one I did last week, but I want to add some new functionality. And of course this needs to work through objects. For one I think the food needs to be more realistic, the increments of stats should be smaller and there should be a limit to how much you can buy or it would be too OP just forever buying cakes. 

Also, the resource selling, I think that should be removed because it's just a little too crude. The emojis should come from an emoji object, once created will act as a library letting me access all the emojis I put in the class for the food and the horse face/body. The shop is also something that should be an object, a shop once created has a certain inventory that will run out if the player buys up all the stock. It will be much easier to display everything now if I have the attributes for everything in the store in arrays I can loop through. Much better than my terrible if/else if chain I had last week.

This will be tough writing everything through objects now, so this may take a while. I better get started.

### Steps ###
Well, I've listed them pretty detailed in my goals, I think I just need to start working to see the exact steps for something this complex.
